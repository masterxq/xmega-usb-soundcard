# XMega usb Soundcard

## Requirements
* XMega ÂµC with USB support
* 8KB ram (Currently configured with big buffer so 16KB without changing the configuration)(Should be possible to get it work with 4KB for lower bitrates <=41 KHz)
* An amplifier for the DAC outputs. An standard OPAMP should do it for the start.

## Features
* Stereo Sound
* Bitrates tested up to 96 KHz
* FIFO-USB Stackcalls
* Fully DMA support
* Clock calibration over time
* Endpoint size for ISONCHRONOUS endpoints up to 1023 bytes
* Acceptable sound Quality

## Limitations

### 12bit DAC
#### Sample cut
The xmega has an 12bit DAC Only and we get 16bit data from the host. It is configured to ignore the 4 lsb. So if the signal is very quiet you will not hear anything.

#### No hardware Volume control
Its not possible to control the Volume in hardware without additionaly external components. So if the audio volume is lowered we will lose resolution on the DAC.
