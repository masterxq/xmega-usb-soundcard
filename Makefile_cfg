# Hey Emacs, this is a -*- makefile -*-
#
# WinAVR makefile written by Eric B. Weddington, Jï¿½rg Wunsch, et al.
# Released to the Public Domain
# Please read the make user manual!

# Additional material for this makefile was submitted by:
#  Tim Henigan
#  Peter Fleury

#
# On command line:
#
# make all = Make software.
#
# make clean = Clean out built project files.
#
# make coff = Convert ELF to AVR COFF (for use with AVR Studio 3.x or VMLAB).
#
# make extcoff = Convert ELF to AVR Extended COFF (for use with AVR Studio
#                4.07 or greater).
#
# make program = Download the hex file to the device, using avrdude.  Please
#                customize the avrdude settings below first!
#
# make filename.s = Just compile filename.c into the assembler code only
#
# To rebuild project do "make clean" then "make all".

# Differences from WinAVR 20040720 sample:
# - DEPFLAGS according to Eric Weddingtion's fix (avrfreaks/gcc-forum)
# - F_CPU Define in CFLAGS and AFLAGS


# MCU name
MCU = atxmega256a3u

# Main Oscillator Frequency
# This is only used to define F_CPU in all assembler and c-sources.
F_CPU = 70272000UL
F_USB = 48000000UL

# Optimization level, can be [0, 1, 2, 3, s].
# 0 = turn off optimization. s = optimize for size.
# (Note: 3 is not always the best optimization level. See avr-libc FAQ.)
OPT = 3

# Target file name (without extension).
TARGET = main


# List C source files here. The main target is automatically added. (C dependencies are automatically generated.)
